# Friday Night Funkin': V-Slice++

Friday Night Funkin' is a rhythm game. Built using HaxeFlixel for Ludem Dare 47.

V-Slice++ is an engine adding QoL improvements and polish to the rough edges of the game.

This game was made with love to Newgrounds and it's community. Extra love to Tom Fulp.
